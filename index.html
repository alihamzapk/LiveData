    <h1 class="display-4">The LiveData Data Model</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      LiveData is a catalog of catalogs. Each catalog, accessible through the LiveData web portal, collects and distributes data conforming to the DataScientia data model. Such a model consisits in the creation, management and distribution of the so-called <b>"Diversity Aware Data"</b>. The key idea behind diversity aware data is to enhance the power of representation of the data, by emphasizing and making concrete the diversity of the data, at different levels. In fact, the information carried by data is not only represented by a single dataset. Rather, it is implicitly hidden in such a dataset by the data source. In the diversity aware data model the information carried by a dataset is represented as a composition of real world entities, described by using a specific language, having a data schema following a specific ontology, as well as using high quality standard data values. More concretely, a diversity aware data can be seen as the composition of 3 main elements; (i) a dataset provided by a <b>data source</b>, (ii) a <b>language datasets</b> describing the terminology adopted by the dataset, (iii) and an <b>ontology</b> representing the data scheme through which the information entities are linked each other. Moreover, the diversity aware data can be represented as a single object, shaped as a <b>Knowledge Graph (KG)</b> where the above three components are composed together. The diversity aware data produced and distributed by DataScientia, through the LiveData network, defines a new generation of data, where the interoperability, quality and data reuse, are the pillars for a more efficient, and less expensive, digital innovation.
